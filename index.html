        <h2 id="where-i-come-from">Where I Come From</h2>

        <p>I'm Mathius Johnson; I'm human. I'm a web developer of three years, and an instructor and mentor on the subject. But where did I get my start?</p>

        <h3 id="early-days">Early Days</h3>

        <p>I always had an interest in technology. Growing up in the 90s I got to witness the emergence of smartphones, 3D gaming, and of course MSN chat ü§£ (and so much more). In my later school years I always spent my spare time in the computer room, got to try out some HTML and CSS in a few computer classes, but never really thought it would lead somewhere for me.</p>

        <div class="dirt">
          <div>
            <p>My dad came from a long line of blue-collar farmers and labourers and I was always told you gotta work hard to earn a living, get your hands and knees in the dirt and tough it out. I also didn't think that was for me, but it seems that ended up where I landed myself eventually!</p>
            <p>...and that's when I really started dreaming about that desk job. </p>
          </div>

        <p>After 7 years working as a cook, 4 years in the landscape industry and 2 children later (Fall 2019), I started doing my research to see what I could do to make a change in my life. I didn't just need this change for myself now, but for my kids as well. I saw an opportunity coming my way... and that was Lighthouse Labs!</p>

        <p>I pushed myself, just like all of you have to complete the grueling hours of this program as best as we all could.</p>

        <p>My first job in-industry after bootcamp was as a vanilla JS front-end and interface developer using DotNetNuke's Content Management System.</p>

        <p>Did I know the ins and outs of CSS or vanilla JS yet? Not really, especially when it came to responsive styling. How about DotNetNuke? I had never used it, never even looked at it.</p>

        <p>Now I'm working as a full-stack developer at Shopify, teammed up on a daily basis with developers who have dedicated their entire lives to programming. And yes, I do feel like an imposter quite often!</p>

        <p>So how did I get by? It is, simply, a willingness to try. You won't know everything at once, you'll never be perfect at everything, or suddenly have all the answers in your head. I didn't. I just wanted to learn, and tried. And tried. And tried. Some concepts I understood quickly, some took time; often more time than I'd liked. But I'm here now, here before you, teaching the same stuff to you that I had found so unfamiliar years ago.</p>

        <p><em>Are you willing to <strong>try</strong>?</em></p>

        <p>I have no background knowledge that most computer science grads would come out with. I can still be too quick to act on fixing a problem, without knowing how to approach it more holisitically. I just like computers and gave programming a real chance. Like me, you're going to a college, and focusing on giving programming a real chance, too. I've got my own strengths and weaknesses, and there's plenty of room for yours too. Care to join me, in this world of web development?</p>

        <p>We're all <strong>developers</strong>. We're all in this together.</p>

        <h2 id="what-is-imposter-syndrome">What is Imposter Syndrome?</h2>

        <p>Like all good chats, we'll start with identifying and explaining the topic.</p>

        <p><strong>The <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/impostor%20syndrome">Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines <em>imposter syndrome</em></a> like so:</strong></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>a psychological condition that is characterized by persistent doubt concerning one's abilities or accomplishments accompanied by the fear of being exposed as a fraud despite evidence of one's ongoing success</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Alright, so it sounds pretty scary. To sum it up more plainly, we experience imposter syndrome as developers a lot; <strong>every time</strong> you feel like <em>you aren't a real developer</em>, you're likely experiencing this phenomenon first-hand.</p>

        <h2 id="youre-probably-already-affected">You're Probably Already Affected</h2>

        <p>When you read that phrase‚Ä¶</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>you aren't a real developer</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>‚Ä¶did that sound eerily familiar?</p>

        <p>What does that little voice in your head say to you on a daily basis? Has it ever said something akin to this sentiment?</p>

        <h2 id="its-normal">It's Normal</h2>

        <p>Every developer has thought this, is currently thinking this, or will think it again down the road. It's par for the course, and is likely to come and go throughout the duration of your career.</p>

        <h2 id="the-reality">The Reality</h2>

        <p>It is easy to begin to get burnt out and make mistakes, and begin to lose confidence. It is also easy to learn a new framework or langauge more slowly than you thought you would. It can be so easy to set unfair expectations for yourself, that you'll never reach; when you fail to reach them you're likely to be hard on yourself. Very hard on yourself. Note that in general, we're often much harder on ourselves than we would be on a friend.</p>

        <p>As an exercise, in a situation like you may be in right now, think to yourself the expectations you'd put on a friend. Would you think them a failure, or imposter, because of where they're at?</p>

        <p><em>Probably not.</em></p>

        <h2 id="waking-up">Waking Up</h2>

        <p>Perhaps an even better exercise involves thinking back months ago.</p>

        <p><strong>Read the following code:</strong></p>

        <pre><code class="language-JavaScript">document.getElementById('contact-form').onSubmit = event =&gt; {
            event.preventDefault();
            fetch('https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts')
                .then(data =&gt; data.json())
                .then(facts =&gt; {
                    const outputElement = document.getElementById('output');
                    facts.forEach(fact =&gt; {
                        outputElement.innerHTML += `&lt;p class="fact"&gt;${fact.text}&lt;/p&gt;`;
                    });
                })
                .catch(error =&gt; {console.error(error);});
        };
        </code></pre>

        <p><em>If you review it carefully‚Ä¶</em></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Can you understand it, reading each line carefully?</li>
          <li>Do you know what language it is, and where it could be run?</li>
          <li>Is it ‚Äúfront-end / client‚Äù or ‚Äúback-end / server‚Äù code?</li>
          <li>Do you have an idea of what it might do, before even running it?</li>
          <li>Would you have known this months ago?
            <ul>
              <li>Before you started at Lighthouse?</li>
              <li>Before you started programming?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is important not to look at how you may be <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/spinning+your+wheels">spinning your tires</a> in the present, but to instead take a step back and breathe. Look at your progress, and relish in your improvement and growth along your journey.</p>

        <p>Programming, web development, or any new skill or shift in careers‚Äînone of this is a simple or straightforward process. Keep in mind too that in web development there is always an update, a new framework to try out, or a new way of doing things. We are consistently challenged to learn, grow, and improve. Going through school, trying our hardest through college programs like this one, we know how much effort it takes and how turbulent the process can be. Sometimes things might click right away, sometimes it happens 3 examples, 5 videos, a book, and <a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/">a chat with a rubber duck</a> later.</p>

        <h3 id="dont-forget-where-you-started">Don't Forget Where you Started</h3>

        <p>One day, not so long ago, you were just starting. A beginner, that wouldn't be able to pick out an integer from a float. Now you've written full-stack applications, have worked in a team using Git, have not only talked the talk but are walking the walk.</p>

        <p>When your fingers are at a keyboard, magic happens. An empty folder is quickly populated with a city of files filled with business of data, and citizens of functions. From nothing: something!</p>

        <p>This should not be taken lightly. Don't just look, but feel where you are now compared to that humble beginning. Say it aloud:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>I can write programs. I know multiple programming languages. I can read documentation. I can build a web application, and already have!</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Like one of your favourite booleans, that statement is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>.</p>

        <p>Spend real time looking back to admire your progress, reflect on the present and what needs to be done, and keep an eye to what is yet to come!</p>

        <h2 id="where-youre-going">Where You're Going</h2>

        <p>Seniors don't know everything. They oft' just know how to get to an answer faster. They've learned how to learn, how to parse documentation and take the important bits quickly. If you do something everyday, sure you'll memorize the commands you use all the time, but more important than that in this forever shifting landscape is your ability to adapt.</p>

        <p>Be willing to try, have something not work, and to try again. Experiment. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>, break things, and roll back. Try things! Keep trying things until it works. Persistance and tenacity are the key.</p>

        <p>Be‚Ä¶</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Adaptable</li>
          <li>Willing-to-Learn</li>
          <li>a Team Player</li>
          <li>Tenacious</li>
          <li><strong><em>You!</em></strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>After all, you've made it this far. If you keep going, where will you end up? Let's find out.</p>
